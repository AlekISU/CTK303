<div>
    <p> [Chorus]<br>
      If you had my love, and I gave you all my trust<br>
      Would you comfort me?<br>
      And if somehow you knew that your love would be untrue<br>
      Would you lie to me and call me "baby"?<br>
    </p>
    <p>
      [Verse 1]<br>
      Now, if I give you me, this is how it's got to be<br>
      First of all, I won't take you cheatin' on me<br>
      Tell me, who can I trust if I can't trust in you?<br>
      And I refuse to let you play me for a fool (Yeah, yeah)<br>
    </p>
      <p>
      [Pre-Chorus]<br>
      You said that we could possibly spend eternity<br>
      (You said that we could possibly spend eternity, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)<br>
      See, that's what you told me, that's what you said<br>
      But if you want me, you have to be fulfilling all my dreams<br>
      (You want me, you have to be fulfilling all my dreams, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)<br>
      If you really want me, bae<br>
      </p>
      <p>
      [Chorus]<br>
      If you had my love, and I gave you all my trust<br>
      Would you comfort me?<br>
      Would you comfort me? Tell me, baby
      And if somehow you knew that your love would be untrue, yeah (How you knew)<br>
      Would you lie to me and call me "baby"? (Na, na, na, na, na)<br>
      </p>
      <p>
      [Verse 2]<br>
      You said you want my love and you've got to have it all<br>
      But first, there are some things you need to know<br>
      If you wanna live with all I have to give<br>
      I need to feel true love or it's got to end, yeah<br>
      </p>
      <p>
      [Pre-Chorus]<br>
      I don't want you trying to get with me (Don't want you)<br>
      (Don't want you trying to get with me, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)<br>
      And I end up unhappy<br>
      I don't need the hurt and I don't need the pain<br>
      So before I do give myself to you<br>
      (So before I do give myself to you, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)<br>
      I have to know the truth<br>
      If I spend my life with you<br>
      </p>
      <p>
      [Chorus]<br>
      If you had my love, and I gave you all my trust (Had my love, gave you trust)<br>
      Would you comfort me? What would you do, babe? Tell me right now<br>
      And if somehow you knew that your love would be untrue (I need to know, be untrue)<br>
      Would you lie to me and call me "baby"? (Don't lie, don't you lie to me)<br>
      If you had my love, and I gave you all my trust (If I gave it to you)<br>
      What would you do? Would you comfort me? (Comfort me, ooh, tell me, baby)<br>
      And if somehow you knew that your love would be untrue (How you knew, be untrue)<br>
      Would you lie to me and call me "baby"? (Would you lie to me? Don't you lie to me, baby)<br>
      </p>
      <p>
      [Bridge]
      Mmm, yeah<br>
      Ooh, na, na, na<br>
      Ooh<br>
      (If you had my)<br>
      </p>
      <p>
      [Chorus]
      If you had my love, and I gave you all my trust<br>
      Would you comfort me? (Would you comfort me? Tell me, baby, oh)<br>
      And if somehow you knew that your love would be untrue (Oh)<br>
      Would you lie to me and call me "baby"? (Don't lie to me, call me "baby")<br>
      If you had my love, and I gave you all my trust (Had my love, gave my trust)<br>
      Would you comfort me? (What would you do if I gave it to you?)<br>
      And if somehow you knew that your love would be untrue (Tell me)<br>
      Would you lie to me and call me "baby"? (Don't you lie to me, call me, call me "baby")<br>
      </p>
      <p>
      [Outro]<br>
      If you had my love, and I gave you all my trust<br>
      Would you comfort me?<br>
      And if somehow you knew that your love would be untrue<br>
      Would you lie to me and call me "baby"?<br>
